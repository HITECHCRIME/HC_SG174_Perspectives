## Notes

HC_SG174_Perspectives

Chant rap type prototype. Posting it here for safekeeping really.
Thank you for sticking with me Agents.

Lyrics in progress, for now structural design coming together.

look look look
look really look
look look look

look really look at your trails of cause
make sure of the specs
what you got at stake in effect
bouncing mirror’s light
not shook with your words of dose

shining bright at your own demise
tanting shivers me inside, but not hate
it’s the sadness of your state
that you need to call upon
marks of other’s progress
in you midst so glistening to the ones
you need to listen to so closely

could omit saying don’t x3
it’s my sacrifice, sacrifice x2

this is not taking me through
to the other side to rot with you
sacrifice, sacrifice
